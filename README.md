# Overview



# Why we choose these phenomena
 1. Verbal complexes: Verbs have to agree with the noun in number and gender. Also implemented present and past. Verbs are very complicated in Spanish, as we mentioned, they have different conjugations for tenses, mood, gender, and number. This complexity was one of the reasons that we chose different verbs with different sentences. The aim was to make XLE recognize the difference and to be able to parse the sentences with the correct verb form. For instance, the verb 'Vamos' is the third person plural form for the verb 'Let's go', and in most languages, the base of the verb is usually the same but you add a suffix to conjugate it in terms of number. However, in Spanish verbs undergo a very intense inflection.
 2. Determiner/Adjective/noun agreement in gender and number, and subject/verb agreement: Spanish grammar requires determiners, adjectives and nouns agree in both gender and number. In terms of gender agreement, we can say that determiners and adjectives must be compatible with the nouns that they modify. For example, we have 'los ninos' and 'las jirafas', 'los' and 'las' are the determiners and they match with the gender of the nouns which respectively are feminine(giraffes) and masculine(boys). If they don't match with the noun, the sentence becomes unparsable.
 3. internal NP structure. Different positioning of the adjectives and adverbs since Spanish is a rather flexible language in terms of word order. In Spanish, there are lots of positions that adverbs and adjectives can be put thanks to its flexible word order structure. For instance adjectives can be positioned before or after the noun that they modify, which is not the case in most languages. As an example, whereas the adjective 'rico' comes before the noun 'alfajor' in the sentence "Pedro no quiere un alfajor.", it(morada) comes after the noun 'camiseta' in the sentence "Vosotros tenéis una camiseta morada.".
 4. Dilect differences: Argentinian dialect vs. Castillian Spanish: differences between in verbs conjugation and pronoun usage.
 5. Subordinate clauses with 'que': Subordinate clauses are very important in Spanish in terms of expressing dependent ideas. And the word 'que' has an important role as a key marker for these clauses since it links them to the main clause. The grammar rules must ensure that the subordinate clauses are embedded to main clauses in a correct way.And indicating that the clause represented by 'que' functions as a complement (COMP), within the structure of the main clause is the way it is usually done. We also made sure that the grammar is working correctly in terms of the elements within the subordinate clause are compatible with number, gender etc. and they relate to elements in the main clause correctly.
 6. Negation with 'no': In Spanish, negation can be applied with the word 'no' to negate the verbs.It is generally placed before the verb, making sure that the negation applies directly to the verb's action. We have used the notation '(^ NEG) = +', that marks the following verb or phrase as negated. For example, in the sentence 'Pedro no quiere un alfajor.', 'no' negates the following verb/verb phrase 'quiere'. 
 7. Imperatives: When we come to the Imperative, we encounter an important feature that distinguishes Spanish from other languages. In most languages, the imperative is usually used in the second person singular or second person plural. However, Spanish also uses the imperative in the third person plural, which is interesting. As in the case of the verb 'Hagamos'. The verb is conjugated in the third person plural and used in the imperative. For this intriguing reason, we wanted to include imperatives in our project.
 8. Yes/no questions: in Argentinian dialect and Castillian Spanish

Clarification: In Spanish, all questions and exclamatory sentences use their respective punctuation marks at the beginning of the sentences and at the end. However, **the XLE or lfg or i dont what it is exactly** does not have the opening question mark **¿** and the opening exclamation mark **¡**. Therefore, we decided to parse the sentences without the question mark and write this disclaimer announcing that they actually exist and should be there in the sentences, we even put it in the grammar in the punctuation section even though they are not used. 

More so, several words in Spanish have an orthographic accent, but the XLE does not recognize them properly in some occasions. So, what we decided to do is to keep them in the cases in which the XLE recognized them and to take them out when they were causing trouble. Nevertheless, there are several verbs in Spanish that need that accent in order to be differentiated in mood and/or tense. For example: *Comé* and *Confiá* are verbs that need the final accent in order to be in an imperative mood in the present tense, otherwise *Come* and *Confia* would still be in the present tense, but the mood changes into indicative. A second example is *Corrió*, in which luckily the accent is recognized in the XLE, which is the past form of the verb *correr* in the 3rd person singular, and this verb form needs the accent to be orthographically correct becuase *corrio* without the accent does not exist. Finally, the accents in *Tenés* and *Querés* are necessary in the Argentinian dialect's way of conjugating the verbs in the 2nd person singular, just like the accent in *Tenéis* for the 2nd person plural in Castillian Spanish. (In case, of receiving an error message when parsing these sentences take into account that the mistake could be the accent recognition, also, if you make a mistake when writing the accents you will have to rewrite the sentences again because the XLE does not catch it correctly.)



# Implementation approach/design

A grammar that can correctly parse and generate syntactic structures with different sentence types is developed for Spanish language, using XLE.
Different phenomena as mentioned above was being tried to be implemented with using the rules of LFG.

The grammar is divided into modules which are 'RULES', 'MORPHOLOGY', 'TEMPLATES', and 'LEXICON'. Such an approach allows each aspect of the grammar to be independently developed and easily progressed. For example, with templates, we can easily refer to our templates when making lexical entries, making our work easier and creating a grammar that is easier to understand.

The grammar created is a rule-based grammar, where specific and customized rules are created according to the structure of certain sentences in Spanish. Each rule is designed to handle different phenomena in the chosen language such as subject-verb agreement, yes-no questions, imperatives etc. For instance the rule "Simp --> e:  {(^ SUBJ PRED) = 'pro' (^ SUBJ PERS) = 2 | (^ SUBJ PRED) = 'pro'(^ SUBJ PERS) = 1};VP." provides that the subject's predicate must be a pronoun, either second or first person, and a verb phrase must follow the subject in order to an imperative sentence to be parsed.

The use of OT Marks:

The use of OT Marks is so important for the grammar to be able to rank and specify th differences amoong the competing syntactic structures. OT marks apply to specific structures and are used to indicate what is preferred or not preferred in those structures. For example, the OT mark '@(OT-MARK Punct)' is applied since punctuation has the potential to affect syntactic structure, semantics, prosody and, of course, meaning, it is important to specify what is preferred in terms of sytantic structure, as mentioned earlier, using OT marks. By adding a punctuation constraint to the XLE, it shows how punctuation is to be handled and ensures that it is compatible with the grammatical rules being encoded.
