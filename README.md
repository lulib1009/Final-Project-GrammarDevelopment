# Overview


# Why we choose these phenomena
 1. Verbal complexes: verbs have to agree with the noun in number and gender. Also implemented present and past.
 2. Determiner/Adjective/noun agreement in gender and number, and subject/verb agreement.
 3. internal NP structure. Different positioning of the adjective and adverbs since spanish is a rahter flexible language in terms of word order.
 4. Dilect differences: Argentinian dialect vs. Castillian Spanish: differences between in verbs conjugation and pronoun usage.
 5. Subordinate clauses with 'que' .
 6. Negation with 'no'
 7. Imperatives maybe????????
